There has been a lot of new things coming now a days. Since the rise of the JavaScript ecosystem. Both in Backend with Node.js and in Frontend with plethora of JavaScript Frameworks while popular frameworks like React and Angular leading the horde.

While Google leading the Development of the Web by making it more secure, performant and immersive. [Alex Russell @slightlyoff](https://github.com/slightlyoff) from Google and [Frances Berriman @phae](https://github.com/phae) discussed on how to enhance the user experience in their article [ Progressive Web Apps: Escaping Tabs Without Losing Our Soul ](https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/) and introduced the term Progressive Web App for the first time and defined what was needed for a Web App to evolve.

And that's when I first heard about this thing called Progressive Web App. These apps can deliver an even better user experience than traditional web apps.

#### So, What is Progressive Web App ?

More precisely,

> "A Progressive Web App uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like user experience. They evolve from pages in browser tabs to immersive, top-level apps, maintaining the web's low friction at every moment."

So in a nutshell, <span style="background-color: #d6ebf2">Progressive Web Apps are Web Apps on steroids</span>, Supercharged to give end users a Native App like experience.

PWA's are quintessentially Web Apps with enhanced User Experience leveraging the power of latest web technologies like [Service Workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers#what_is_a_service_worker), [Web App Manifests](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/) etc.


#### Is my Web App, a Progressive Web App ?

To find answer to this question is same as finding answer to any other question nowadays, "Ask Google" and If you are lazy not to ask Google, Let me google that for you - [click here](http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=progressive+web+app+checklist) and Go to the First link you find out.

I've listed some steroids Web Apps need to take to call it a PWA. 

**Responsive**

For making a web app truly give an app like experience, it must be Responsive and work seamlessly in Smartphones.

**Independent from Connectivity**

One of the steroid which makes PWA much interesting is its independence from Netowork Connectivity. Using â€‹[Service Workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers#what_is_a_service_worker) for taking over the network, as every network activity that client does passes through the Service Worker and then over to the Network. And what this provide serving the client with data even if they are not connected to the Internet.

Since the introduction of AJAX around year 2000, there had been many new technologies introduced to make the best of Web. Such as Adobe AIR, Microsoft Sliverlight and more. But they were not on par with, how AJAX changed the way developers constructed their Web Apps. Until almost 15 years later with the introduction of [Service Workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers#what_is_a_service_worker). By providing a totally new paragdim for developers to play with.

**App like Experience**

Designing the Interface of the Web App such that, is behaves similar to any native app. Thus, making it worthy of having place amongst native apps providing a fully immersive experience. 

**Re-engagement**

To make client visit the App again and again, implementing various re-engagement techniques such as Push Notifications, Installing Web App to Home Screen and more.
 

Web Apps take advantage of these latest technologies and stratagies which help them supercharge themselves and provide a fast and reliable user experience.
