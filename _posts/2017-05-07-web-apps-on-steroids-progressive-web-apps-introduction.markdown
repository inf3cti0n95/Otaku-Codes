There has been a lot of new things coming now a days. Since the rise of the JavaScript ecosystem. Both in Backend with Node.js and in Frontend with plethora of JavaScript Frameworks while popular frameworks like React and Angular leading the horde.

While Google leading the Development of the Web by making it more secure, performant and immersive. [Alex Russell @slightlyoff](https://github.com/slightlyoff) from Google and [Frances Berriman @phae](https://github.com/phae) discussed on how to enhance the user experience in their article [ Progressive Web Apps: Escaping Tabs Without Losing Our Soul ](https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/) and introduced the term Progressive Web App for the first time and defined what was needed for a Web App to evolve.

And that's when I first heard about this thing called Progressive Web App. Since the introduction of AJAX around year 2000, there had been many new technologies introduced to make the best of Web. Such as Adobe AIR, Microsoft Sliverlight and more. But they were not on par with, how AJAX changed the way developers constructed their Web Apps. Until almost 15 years later with the introduction of [Service Workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers#what_is_a_service_worker).

Progressive Web Apps take advantage of these latest technologies which helped them supercharge web apps and provide a fast and reliable user experience.
