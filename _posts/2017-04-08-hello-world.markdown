#### So, Who Am I?

Easy, I am Viraj Trivedi, a Computer Engineering Undergrad from India. Crazy about all the **Otaku** things that you can think of.

#### Otaku?, what is that?

Otaku (オタク), according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku) is a Japanese term for people with obsessive interests, commonly the anime and manga fandom.

So, an Otaku person is a Geek, Nerd always into Manga, Anime, Computers and Other Nerdy things. ***Yes, that is what I am in real life.***

#### What do I do? *Other than Anime and Manga Stuff*

- I code, checkout my [Github](https://github.com/inf3cti0n95/), [Codepen](http://codepen.io/inf3cti0n95/).
- I read stuff, checkout my [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/viraj_trivedi). 
- I eat (a lot of exquisite stuff).
- I draw Anime Characters, checkout my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_viraj.trivedi_/).

#### Reason behind this Blog.

Nothing fancy, just to share My Experiences (*I ain't an Old Guy, I am just 21 years old.*) and My silly coding mistakes with everyone, and share my journey to become **the King of Coders** *#LuffyOnePiece* and Obviously to **Make the World a Better Place**.

#### TL;DR

How big of an Otaku, Awesome, Lazy and Crazy I am.
