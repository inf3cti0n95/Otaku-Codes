There has been a lot of new things coming now a days. Since the rise of the JavaScript ecosystem. Both in backend with Node.js and in frontend with plethora of JavaScript Frameworks while popular frameworks like React and Angular leading the horde.

While JavaScript leading the Development of the Web by making it more secure, performant and immersive.

In mid 2015, [Alex Russell](https://github.com/slightlyoff) from Google and [Frances Berriman](https://github.com/phae) discussed on how to enhance the user experience in a article [ **Progressive Web Apps: Escaping Tabs Without Losing Our Soul**](https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/) and introduced the term ***Progressive Web App*** for the first time, defining what was needed for a Web App to evolve.

And that's when I first heard about called a ***Progressive Web App***.

#### So, What is a "Progressive Web App" ?

More precisely,

PWA's are quintessentially Web Apps with enhanced User Experience leveraging the power of latest web technologies like [Service Workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers#what_is_a_service_worker), [Web App Manifests](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/) etc.

In a nutshell, <span style="background-color: #d6ebf2">&nbsp;Progressive Web Apps are Web Apps on steroids </span>, supercharged to give end users a Native App like experience.

I've listed some steroids Web Apps need to take to call it a PWA. 

- **Responsive**

  For making a web app truly give an app like experience, it must be Responsive and work seamlessly in Smartphones.

- **Independent from Connectivity**

  One of the steroid which makes PWA much interesting is its independence from Network. Using â€‹[Service Workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers#what_is_a_service_worker) to take over the network, as every network activity that user does passes through the Service Worker and then to the Network.Which provides serving the user with data even if they are not connected to the Internet.

  Since the introduction of AJAX around year 2000, there had been many new technologies introduced to make the best of Web. Such as Adobe AIR, Microsoft Silverlight and more. But they were not on par with, how AJAX changed the way developers constructed their Web Apps. Until almost 15 years later with the introduction of [Service Workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers#what_is_a_service_worker). By providing a new paradigm for developers to play with.

- **App like Experience**

  Designing the Interface of the Web App such that, is behaves similar to any native app. Thus, making it worthy of having place amongst native apps providing a fully immersive experience. 

- **Re-engagement**

  To make user visit the App again and again, implementing various re-engagement techniques such as Push Notifications, Installing Web App to Home Screen and more.
 

Web Apps take advantage of these latest technologies and strategies which help them supercharge themselves and provide a fast and reliable user experience.

#### Reason behind talking about Progressive Web Apps

To introduce PWA's and its superpowers to developer fanatics, who always wants to be on the bleeding edge of the technologies.

For next few articles, I'll be talking about different approaches and features (Steroids) to make your web app <span style="background-color: #00FF00">&nbsp;a Hulk like Web App </span>, smashing out the boring parts.

#### TL;DR

How awesome Progressive Web Apps are and why I'll be talking a lot about it in future.
